# Kit Shipping

Part of the Kit Logistics Coordinator's responsibilities cover moving either whole or parts of kits around the UK and the world. This is generally referred to as shipping \(even though it rarely involves ships!\). There are specific points throughout the year when kit needs to be shipped and the procedures followed are detailed in the [Procedures](/kit-transport/procedures.md) chapter.

## General shipping info

### Packaging

* Kits should generally be shipped in the while 18l Really Useful Box \(RUB\).
* All parts of the kit should be suitably protected either in Jiffy bags or bubble wrap.
* Batteries **must** be placed inside the charging bag.
* In general no more than two batteries should be shipped in each RUB \(to ease shipping restrictions\).
* Damaged batteries must not be shipped.
* Any empty space in the box should be filled with paper or bubble wrap. No packing peanuts; They're messy.
* The box should be sealed with cable ties and high quality tape over the handles \(not selotape or insulating tape\).
