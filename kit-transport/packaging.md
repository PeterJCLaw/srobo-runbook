# Packaging

* Kits should generally be shipped in the while 18l Really Useful Box \(RUB\).
* All parts of the kit should be suitably protected either in Jiffy bags or bubble wrap.
* Batteries **must** be placed inside the charging bag.
* In general no more than two batteries should be shipped in each RUB \(to ease shipping restrictions\).
* Damaged batteries must not be shipped.
* Any empty space in the box should be filled with paper or bubble wrap. No packing peanuts; They're messy.
* The box should be sealed with cable ties and high quality tape over the handles \(not selotape or insulating tape\).
