# Couriers

We have confirmed that the following couriers are happy handling packages containing lithium polymer batteries:

* Interlink [http://www.interlinkdirect.co.uk/](http://www.interlinkdirect.co.uk/)

Kit data for couriers:

* Dimensions: 48cm x 39cm x 20cm
* Weight: 6kg \(A kit weighs 4.95kg [ref](https://bitbucket.org/richardbarlow/sr-kit-coord/wiki/Kit Definition). 6kg gives some headroom\)
* Value \(for insurance\): £500
* Batteries: Lithium Ion. Packed with equipment. Batteries less than 100Wh.

In all circumstances a shipment of a kit must have at least £500 worth of insurance.

Note that the above package details are repeated in the loan extension instructions in [return-shipping-pack.git](https://github.com/srobo/return-shipping-pack/tree/master/instructions) and therefore should be updated there when the details change.
