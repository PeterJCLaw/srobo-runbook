# Tinker Time Coordinator

The tinker-time coordinator controls access to the arenas during 'tinker time',
a period at the start of the competition where competitors can give their robot
a quick test in the actual arena environment.

The coordinator maintains a schedule of which team is in which arena, at which
time. The tinker time is divided into 10 minute slots, with one team able to
use one corner of each arena for each slot. The coordinator should develop
their own mechanism for scheduling and recording tinker time access (for
example, producing a table in a log book and writing team names into it). Teams
wishing to make use of tinker time will approach the coordinator, and
negotiate access.

Teams should only have one booking at a time (i.e. can't book multiple slots),
to avoid people booking everything up immediately.

The coordinator is responsible for controlling team-access to the staging
area during tinker time: multiple team members should be allowed access to the
arenas during this period (in contrast with during matches), but only teams
who have booked time. Once their time is up, the coordinator should instruct
the teams whose bookings have expired to leave.
