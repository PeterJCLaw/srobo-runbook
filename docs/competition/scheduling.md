Considerations for scheduling of time on the days:
- teams will have travelled in on the Saturday morning, so starting later is better but also shouldn't go too late
- teams will have stayed overnight, so Sunday can start earlier
- teams will want to leave in good time on Sunday afternoon, so finishing earlier is better

- the first round of matches is usually run with more spacing in order to allow the teams and marshals to get used to running the arena

- guests who are coming to see interesting matches will be invited primarily to the knockouts/finals, so being able to publish the timings for that is good

- it sounds obvious, but do think through what happens after the final, notably you need to account for:
  - a tiebreaker (if we want to allow for that)
  - the prizegiving
  - kit handback
