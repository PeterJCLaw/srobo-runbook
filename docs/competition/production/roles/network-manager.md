# Network Manager

The network manager is responsible for designing, installing and
uninstalling the network at the competition.

## Subordinates

The network manager may bring in subordinate volunteers.  These
volunteers may not create further subordinate roles.

## Preparation

A survey of the venue before the event is strongly encouraged to ensure that the
planned layout will match what's physically in the venue. This is based on
feedback from SR2019.
