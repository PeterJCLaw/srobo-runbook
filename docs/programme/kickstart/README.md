# Kickstart

Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year, where the game will
be announced and robotics kits will be handed out to the teams.

In order to reduce the amount of travelling that teams need to do, and to enable
us to make use of smaller venues, Kickstart typically happens at several venues
though all on the same day.

Kickstart is both our opportunity to enthuse the competitors about the
competition and the challenge we're setting them as well as to set them up to
succeed at that.

There are three main parts to Kickstart as we currently run it:

* Presentation, covering
    * What Student Robotics is
    * Introduction to the kit
    * Timeline to the competition event
    * The game
* Kit handout
* Microgames

## Microgames

The microgames are a set of challenges which aim to teach the competitors about
the kits and ensure that they can use them safely. The exact nature of the tasks
changes a little each year, though typically involve using at least the vision
system and the sensing and output capabilities of the Ruggeduino.
