# Tasks

We record tasks which need doing at https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues.

If you spot a task which you'd like to do, please `@mention` the person who
created the task to let them know that you're interested. If you're able to
self-assign the task (for technical reasons you won't initially be able to do
this), please also do that.

<!--- Review question: is the original author the right person to ping here? --->

This lets the original author know that you're interested, meaning that they can
pass on any additional information which might be needed to complete the task.
Alternatively, if they're unsure, they can likely suggest someone else who would
be able to advise you.

Assignment also acts as a way for others to know that you're working on
something, so that they don't need to duplicate your efforts!

If you see a task which you think someone else would be able to take on (perhaps
because they expressed a particular interest in doing so, or are already doing
something very similar), please @mention them on the task asking if they'd be
interested.

!!! note

    Please do _not_ assign other people to tasks unless they have specifically
    said that they are doing the task.

If you're asked whether you can take on a task, there is no obligation to do so.
However please do ensure that you respond in a timely fashion so it's clear you
won't be able to take on a task.

If you've taken on a task and find that you no longer have the time or energy to
complete it, that's fine! However please do post on the task mentioning that
you're no longer able to complete it and remove your assignment from the task.
Please also consider `@mention`ing either the author or another volunteer who
has been helping you with the task in order to let them know.

If there's something you'd like to do which isn't already expressed as a task,
please do create a task first as a record that you're doing it. There's no need
to do this for trivial things, but for anything else having a task provides
visibility into what's being done and who's doing it.
