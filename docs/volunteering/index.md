# Getting Involved

Student Robotics is powered by volunteers. We have a variety of skills and
backgrounds, but share a passion for encouraging the teams through the medium of
robotics.

There are a lots of different ways you can get involved. Whether it's mentoring
a team through the competition year, helping run one of our events or developing
our hardware or software, this runbook is the place to look for guidance on how
we do things.

## What to expect

When you first start helping out, you'll have a chat with a volunteer
co-ordinator who will be able to tell you a bit more about how we're organised
and work with you to find things you'd like to help with. They'll also ask you
for contact details and for you to read the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].

They'll also be able to answer any questions you have about the organisation and
get you set up with accounts on our collaboration platforms (we primarily use
[Slack][sr-slack] and [GitHub][sr-github]).

## Tasks

_**Main article**_: [Tasks](./tasks.md)

Our main list of tasks is at https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues. If there's
something you'd like to get involved with doing, discussing on the task there
(and possibly creating one if needed) is the way to go.
