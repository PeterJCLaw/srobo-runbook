# Student Robotics Volunteer RunBook

Welcome to our runbook. This aims to be a single source for all Student Robotics
internal documentation, including information for the [Competition Team][competition-team]
and [Kit Team][kit-team] as well as other activities.

## Content Guidance

The runbook aims to document all the Student Robotics specific information which
a volunteer might need. This includes the historic context for the way that
things are currently done, the reasons behind that approach, as well as the
instructions on how to do things.

In that regard, the runbook aims to be _descriptive_ rather than _prescriptive_.
We are always open to new ways to do things, though by recording the reasons
for our current approach we aim to avoid needing to rediscover that repeatedly.

The runbook aims to be complete as far as our own specific information goes,
however creating documentation for external tools is deliberately out of scope.
As a concrete example: we might include here some guidance on how _we_ use a
tool (perhaps including recipes for patterns common to us), however we should
not be directly documenting how to use the tool. In the latter case we should
link to the tool's own documentation. (If that tool's documentation is
insufficient then we should submit improvements to that project!)
