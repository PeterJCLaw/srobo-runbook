# Asset Tracking

One of the responsibilities of the Kit Logistics Coordinator is to maintain a record of the location and state of all Student Robotics assets. This is generally referred to as Asset Tracking. It is important that the organisation is aware of the location and state of all of its assets at all times.

## The Inventory

To record all of the necessary information regarding Student Robotics assets, all[^1] assets are tracked in the Inventory. It is important to note that only property of Student Robotics is tracked in the Inventory; meaning that property of third parties must not be tracked in the Inventory.

The Inventory primarily records the location of each asset, its physical and functional state, its asset code and a history of any changes made to any of these properties. Of particular importance here is the asset code, which uniquely identifies the asset in the Inventory. Without the asset code it would be impossible to tie up a record in the Inventory with the physical asset that it is tracking. It is therefore very important that all assets have their asset code clearly marked on them.

[^1]: This is not quite true as certain low-value assets are not tracked individually.
